    <faq id="how-to-add-generated-sources">
      <question>How do I add my generated sources to the compile path of Maven, when using Modello?</question>
      <answer>
        <p>Modello generate the sources in the generate-sources phase and automatically adds the
          source directory for compilation in Maven. So you don't have to copy the generated sources.
        </p>
        <p>You have to declare the <a href="https://codehaus-plexus.github.io/modello/modello-maven-plugin/">Modello Maven Plugin</a>
          in the build of your project for source generation (in that way the sources are generated each time).
        </p>
