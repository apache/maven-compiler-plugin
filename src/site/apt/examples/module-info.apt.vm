Older projects with module-info

  Projects that want to be compatible with older versions of Java (i.e 1.8 or below bytecode and API), but also want to provide a
  <<<module-info.java>>> for use on Java 9+ runtime, must be aware that they need to call <<<javac>>> twice:
  
  [[1]] the <<<module-info.java>>> must be compiled with <<<release=9>>>,

  [[2]] while the rest of the sources must be compiled with the lower expected compatibility version of <<<source>>>/<<<target>>>.

  []

  The preferred way to do this is by having 2 execution blocks, as described below:

  [[1]] default <<<default-compile>>> execution with <<<release=9>>>,

  [[2]] additional custom <<<base-compile>>> execution with expected target compatibility.

  []

  Notice that, in addition, JDK 9 only supports compilations for Java 6 and above, so projects wanting to be compatible with Java 5 or below need
  to use two different JDKs for the 2 executions. With {{{/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html}toolchains}} configuration, it is
  quite easy to achieve this, even if a little bit more complex.

* Java 6 to 8 Compatibility

  In case you want the project to be Java 6, 7 or 8 compatible, you can simply use JDK 9 for both execution blocks.

  The easiest way is to use Java 9 as the runtime for Maven, by setting <<<JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-9>>> before running <<<mvn>>>.
  But if you want to use an older Java runtime for Maven, you can use the maven-toolchain-plugin to specify the shared JDK
  or a custom jdkToolchain and refer to the JDK 9 installation on your system.

* Java 5 or below Compatibility

  Given that Maven 3 requires newer Java release at runtime, you'll absolutely need to use Toolchains to use a JDK different from
  Maven runtime.

  You could add a jdkToolchain to do base-compile execution-block as well referring to JDK 5.
